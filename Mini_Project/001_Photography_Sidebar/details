Project: Sidebar for Photography Website
In this project, I created a responsive sidebar navigation menu for a photography-themed website using only HTML and CSS.
The core functionality of the sidebar toggle is achieved using the :checked pseudo-class on a hidden checkbox input via label, allowing smooth transitions without any JavaScript.
